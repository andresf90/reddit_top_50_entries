# Reddit Client

Reddit Client is build in React JS and also using Redux and redux-persist, this app is to consult post entries from reddit from differents topics.

With this application you can choose a post from reddit and then the system will mark the publication as read and show the details on the right side, you can also dismiss the post if you do not want to see more, the system will keep your status even if the browser is updating.

## Technologies used
```
ReactJS as a Front-End Javascript Framework 
Redux

## Important Decisions taken
I decided in the components folder separate the vie and index because is a best practice.

I decided used eslint and prettier vscode to improve the code presentation and use of the airbnb standars.
